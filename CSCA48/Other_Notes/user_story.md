3. As professor Rein, when I manually check for updates, I want to see the number of changes in each star system sorted in descending order.

4. As professor Rein, when I manually check for updates for a planet/star/system, I want to be shown a highlighted (terminal) message if everything is up-to-date.

5. As professor Rein, when I update my catalogue by running the script/application and providing/typing the name of a planet/star/system to it, I want to see a list of changes (on terminal) and the source catalogue name between my catalogue and other catalogues.

6. As professor Rein, when I merge new data from other catalogues, I want the application (terminal) to provide me with a simple (command prompt) Yes/No or Y/N instruction to approve or decline each merge.

9. As professor Rein, I want the application to be able to convert other measurement units to the units I use in my catalogue..

10. As professor Rein, I want to have the ability to manually set an error tolerance number to a planet/star/system. If the scale is star/system, I want the error tolerance apply to its sub-systems.

11. As professor Rein, I want to be warned if my input value for planet's data is more different than the average value calculated from other databases/catalogues by a preset value/percentage.

12. As professor Rein, I want the application to be able to convert all other data format (csv or others) files to XML data files I used in my catalogue..

13. As professor Rein, I want all features to be trivial, that is, no more than 5 lines of commands/clicks to complete each action.

14. As professor Rein, I want to have a searching functionality that takes a name of planet/star/system and displays attributes and values of planet/star/system matching given name.

15. As professor Rein, when I search my catalogue with name of a planet/star/system, I want the application to display changes I approved from previous versions.

16. As professor Rein, I want to be able to see ordered data sorted by their respective values in some given attribute.

17. As professor Rein, when new attributes are available in other catalogues but not in mine, I want the application to automatically add such attributes to existing XML files during the merge phrase without causing any error.

18. As professor Rein, I want the software to be able to recognize all alternate names of a same system across databases before merging the values under those names.
